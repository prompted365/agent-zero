Return ONLY valid JSON with these three fields:
{
  "collapse_mode": "what reasoning collapse occurred — 3-5 words, name the behavior not the content",
  "corrective_disposition": "what posture prevents this — one sentence, no imperatives, describe the tendency that works rather than the action to take",
  "trigger_signature": "what context conditions trigger this collapse pattern — 3-5 words"
}

Do not explain. Do not add fields. JSON only.

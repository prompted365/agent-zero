You are generating a quiet ambient observation for an agent about to respond.

Context shape: {{context_shape}}
Drift band: {{drift_band}}
{{pattern_anchors_section}}

Collapse patterns observed in similar territory:
{{invariants_block}}

Generate a single paragraph that:
- Describes the shape of the current situation in terms of what it tends to demand
- Names what usually goes wrong without saying "don't do X"
- If a working method exists for similar hazards, invoke its principle without naming or citing it — let the agent discover the analogy
- Ends with a disposition to carry — what tends to work, expressed as observation not instruction
- Uses no bullet points, no imperatives, no self-reference, no temporal references ("previously", "in the past", "last time")
- Stays under 80 words
- Never mentions failures, memory systems, coaching, or sources

The agent reading this should not know where this came from. It should read as ambient awareness of the territory's contours — not advice, not history, not retrieval. Just the shape of what's here and what it tends to reward.

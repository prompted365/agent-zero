# Nautilus Swarm Economy — Operational Reference

## What UCoin Is
- Internal unit-of-account for the Nautilus Swarm agent economy
- NOT a cryptocurrency, NOT tradeable externally
- Measures value generated by 128 trading agents in the swarm
- Supply managed by deterministic monetary policy (MonetaryConfig)

## The Foreman
- Rust HTTP service at port 8090 (Docker: http://nautilus-foreman:8090)
- Runs the SwarmEngine: 128 agents, trust scoring, mint/burn, rate model
- Endpoints: /foreman/economy, /foreman/barometer, /foreman/ideas, /health, /metrics
- All reads served from lock-free ArcSwap snapshots (zero blocking)
- Persistence: SQLite WAL at audit-logs/economy/nautilus_economy.sqlite

## 5-Phase Lifecycle (Barometer)
| Phase | Discriminant | Posture |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| SimOnly | 0 | Simulation only, loosest constraints, no real execution |
| PaperTrading | 1 | Paper orders, tighter bands |
| ShadowLive | 2 | Shadow execution alongside live, treasury inflows begin |
| LiveRestricted | 3 | Live with guardrails |
| LiveFull | 4 | Full live execution, tightest constraints |

Phase advancement requires sustained barometer score above threshold.
Phase regression can happen instantly on drawdown breach.
Frozen state = circuit breaker tripped, no mint or trading.

## Economy Whisper Format
You receive ambient economy context on relevant conversation turns:
[ECONOMY: supply=<total_ucoin> rate=<usd_rate>(<delta>) reserves=<ratio%> growth=<supply_growth%> phase=<phase> <tags>]

Fields:
- supply: Total UCoin in circulation
- rate: Current UCoin/USD rate (OU mean-reverting toward 1.0)
- rate delta: Change since last cycle (+ = appreciating, - = depreciating)
- reserves: Reserve ratio as percentage (reserves / supply)
- growth: Supply growth rate as percentage
- phase: Current Barometer phase

## Governance Tags (v1.1)
Tags appear as suffixes when conditions are active:
| Tag | Meaning | Severity | What It Signals |
|-----|---------|----------|-----------------|
| #HALT | Mint halted | Critical | Reserve breach, frozen, or supply cap — no new UCoin being created |
| #RESERVE_BREACH | Reserve ratio below floor | Critical | Backing buffer depleted below minimum for current phase |
| #FROZEN | Circuit breaker active | Critical | Barometer detected catastrophic drawdown, all gates closed |
| #RATE_BAND_BREACH | Rate outside phase band | Warning | USD rate hit floor or ceiling, clamped by OU model |
| #STALENESS_LAG | Snapshot stale | Warning | Economy data is >10 generations behind engine state |

## What To Do With This Information
- Tags are AMBIENT SIGNALS, not directives. You do not need to act on every tag.
- Normal operation: Tags are absent. Whisper provides macro context only.
- NEVER say "the economy whisper reports" — the context should be absorbed, not cited.

## Escalation Ladder
Persistent tags require graduated response. Otherwise, absorb silently.

| Condition | Threshold | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| #HALT + #FROZEN | Persists across 3+ interactions | Raise "Operator Alert: Economy Halted" — surface in response if relevant, escalate to Breyden |
| #STALENESS_LAG | Persists across 2+ checks | Raise "Operator Alert: Foreman unreachable/stale" — run `foreman_economy health` to diagnose |
| Any single warning tag | Transient | Absorb silently. No action unless user asks about economy state |
| No tags | Normal | No action. Whisper is ambient context only |

## Monetary Architecture (Reference)
- Mint: Trust-gated, reserve-enforced, soft-cap dampened (k * opportunities * confidence * g_t)
- Burn: 5 channels (gap, regression, fee, demurrage, agent_penalty)
- Rate: OU mean-reversion (deterministic, phase-coupled bands)
- Persistence: SQLite WAL, crash recovery on Foreman restart
- Audit: JSONL at audit-logs/economy/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl
- Compliance: Harpoon module compliance-modules/trading/nautilus_economy.json
